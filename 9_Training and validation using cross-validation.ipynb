    "### Explanation of Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The following metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the LightGBM classifier with cross-validation on the fraud detection task:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: The proportion of total predictions that were correct. In imbalanced datasets, accuracy can be misleading, as a model can achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision**: The proportion of positive predictions (fraud) that were actually correct. High precision means that when the model predicts fraud, it is usually correct. Important when the cost of a false positive is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The proportion of actual fraud cases that were correctly identified. High recall means the model detects most frauds. Important when missing a fraud case is costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It balances the trade-off between precision and recall, especially useful for imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ROC-AUC Score**: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes across all thresholds. A higher ROC-AUC indicates better overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classification Report**: Provides a detailed breakdown of precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class (fraud and not fraud).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In fraud detection, recall and ROC-AUC are often prioritized, as it is crucial to identify as many fraudulent transactions as possible, even if it means accepting some false positives."
