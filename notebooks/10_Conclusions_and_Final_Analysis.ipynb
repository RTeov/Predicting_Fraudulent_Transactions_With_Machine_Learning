    "## Evaluation Metrics: Project-Wide Update (2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "All model notebooks in this project now include a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics for fraud detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Overall proportion of correct predictions. Can be misleading for imbalanced data.\n",
    "- **Precision**: Proportion of predicted frauds that are actually fraud. Important for minimizing false positives.\n",
    "- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Proportion of actual frauds correctly identified. Crucial for minimizing missed fraud.\n",
    "- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall. Balances the trade-off, especially for imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "- **ROC-AUC Score**: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes across all thresholds. High values indicate strong discrimination.\n",
    "- **Classification Report**: Detailed breakdown of precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why These Metrics?\n",
    "Fraud detection is a highly imbalanced classification problem. Relying on accuracy alone can be misleading, as a model could predict all transactions as legitimate and still achieve high accuracy. Therefore, precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC are prioritized to ensure both high fraud detection and minimal disruption to legitimate transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Harmonized Evaluation Across Models\n",
    "- All model notebooks (Random Forest, AdaBoost, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Cross-Validation) now include code and markdown cells for these metrics.\n",
    "- This ensures consistent, interpretable, and business-relevant evaluation throughout the project.\n",
    "- The approach supports robust model comparison and transparent reporting for stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This harmonized evaluation framework is now a core part of the project and is reflected in all analysis and results.**"
