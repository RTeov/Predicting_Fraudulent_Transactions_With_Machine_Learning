## 📈 Evaluation Metrics (2025 Project Update)

All model notebooks in this project now include a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics for fraud detection:

- **Accuracy**: Overall proportion of correct predictions. Can be misleading for imbalanced data.
- **Precision**: Proportion of predicted frauds that are actually fraud. Important for minimizing false positives.
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Proportion of actual frauds correctly identified. Crucial for minimizing missed fraud.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall. Balances the trade-off, especially for imbalanced datasets.
- **ROC-AUC Score**: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes across all thresholds. High values indicate strong discrimination.
- **Classification Report**: Detailed breakdown of precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

### Why These Metrics?
Fraud detection is a highly imbalanced classification problem. Relying on accuracy alone can be misleading, as a model could predict all transactions as legitimate and still achieve high accuracy. Therefore, precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC are prioritized to ensure both high fraud detection and minimal disruption to legitimate transactions.

### Harmonized Evaluation Across Models
- All model notebooks (Random Forest, AdaBoost, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBn) now include code and markdown cells for these metrics.
- This ensures consistent, interpretable, and business-relevant evaluation throughout the project.
- The approach supports robust model comparison and transparent reporting for stakeholders.

### 📊 Visualization Tools
- **Confusion Matrix:** True/false positive and negative visualization
- **ROC Curves:** Model discrimination capability assessment
- **Feature Importance:** Identification of most predictive features
- **Cross-Validation Curves:** Model stability assessment

### 💡 Business Metrics
- **False Positive Rate:** Legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged
- **False Negative Rate:** Fraud transactions missed by the model
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Financial impact assessment

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### ▶️ Run Locally (Batch Inference)

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Prepare your input data:**
   - Place your input CSV (with the required columns) in the project directory.
3. **Edit `app/main.py`:**
   - Implement your batch logic (e.g., load input CSV, run predictions, save output CSV).
4. **Run the batch script:**
   ```bash
   python app/main.py
   ```


---


## ☁️ AWS Credentials: Manual Input Option

**Manual Credentials (for local Docker or custom cloud runs):**

- You can provide AWS credentials manually in `config.yaml` under the `aws_credentials` section:

   ```yaml
      aws_credentials:
         aws_access_key_id: "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
         aws_secret_access_key: "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
         aws_session_token: "YOUR_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN"  # Required only for temporary credentials (leave blank for long-term keys)
   ```

- These credentials will be set as environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`) at runtime by the batch scripts.

**About `aws_session_token`:**
- If you are using temporary AWS credentials (such as those from an IAM role, federated login, or STS), you must provide `aws_session_token` as well.
- For long-term access keys, leave `aws_session_token` blank or omit it.
- Alternatively, you can set them as Docker environment variables at runtime:

   ```sh
   docker run -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret fraud-batch
   ```

**Security Note:**
> Never commit real credentials to version control. Use environment variables or secrets management in production.

---

### ☁️ Run on AWS (SageMaker Batch/Processing)

1. **Build Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t fraud-batch .
   ```
2. **Push to ECR:**
   ```bash
   # Authenticate Docker to ECR
   aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
   # Tag and push
   docker tag fraud-batch:latest <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/fraud-batch:latest
   docker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/fraud-batch:latest
   ```
3. **Launch a SageMaker Processing or Batch Transform job:**
   - Use the ECR image and specify S3 input/output locations.
   - Your script in `app/main.py` should use `boto3` to download input data from S3 and upload results back to S3.

---
## 🛠️ Production/Batch Inference & AWS Integration (2025 Update)

This project is now structured for batch or event-driven inference, suitable for AWS SageMaker, Batch, or Lambda workflows. The REST API (FastAPI) code has been removed for a simpler, script-based deployment.

### 🗂️ Project Structure (Key Folders)
```
app/
    main.py           # Batch/script entrypoint (edit for your workflow)
    models/
        predictor.py  # Model loading and batch prediction logic
- **📊 Comprehensive Analysis**: 10 detailed Jupyter notebooks (now in `notebooks/` folder) covering the complete ML pipeline (for local development only)
    __init__.py
    models/__init__.py

requirements.txt      # Now includes only core, ML, and boto3 dependencies
Dockerfile            # Runs app/main.py for batch inference
.env                  # Environment variables (e.g., model path)
serve.py              # (To be deleted if present; not needed for batch)
tests/                # Placeholder for batch/boto3-based tests
```

### 🚀 How to Run Batch Inference

1. **Build Docker Image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t fraud-batch .
   ```
2. **Run Batch Script:**
   ```bash
   docker run --env-file .env fraud-batch
   ```
   Edit `app/main.py` to implement your batch or event-driven logic (e.g., load data from S3, run predictions, save results).

3. **AWS SageMaker/Boto3:**
   - Use this image as a custom container for SageMaker Processing or Batch Transform jobs.
   - Use `boto3` in your script to interact with S3 or other AWS services.

### ⚡ AWS CLI and boto3 Requirements

- **AWS CLI** is required on your local machine or CI/CD environment to build, tag, and push Docker images to Amazon ECR, and to manage AWS resources (ECR, SageMaker, S3, etc.).
    - [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
    - Configure with `aws configure` before pushing images or running AWS commands.
- **boto3** is required in your Python environment (and is included in `requirements.txt`) for any script that interacts with AWS services (e.g., S3, SageMaker) at runtime.
    - No need to install AWS CLI inside your Docker image—only on your local/dev machine.


### 📝 Example Batch Script (app/main.py) with YAML Config
```python
import yaml
import os
# from app.models.predictor import get_model, predict_transaction
# import boto3
# import pandas as pd

def load_config(config_path="../config.yaml"):
   with open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), config_path), "r") as f:
      return yaml.safe_load(f)

if __name__ == "__main__":
   config = load_config()
   print("Loaded config:", config)
   # Example: use config values
   # input_data = config["input_data"]
   # model_path = config["model_path"]
   # Implement your batch logic here using config values
   # For AWS: use config["aws"]["s3_bucket"] etc.
```

> **Note:** Project configuration is now managed via `config.yaml`. Adjust paths, model settings, and AWS parameters there for both local and cloud runs.

> **Note:** This project is now optimized for batch/script-based inference and AWS SageMaker/Boto3 workflows. Edit `app/main.py` to implement your batch or event-driven logic.

---
